# Slingshot-Simulator

This simple project allows a player to shoot stones with a slingshot.

The technologies used in this project are:
- 2x Myo Armband (left forearm + right upperarm)
- 1x Oculus Rift
- 1x Wireless Mouse

You can just drop the Player-Prefab into your scene and you can rotate and shoot your targets. If the Myos are on the wrong side, just press L or R to switch the sides.

Snap the imaginary sling with the left mouse key and just release it. If you do everything right, the scripts will spawn a stone, that smashes every Rigid Body and opens the Hit-method for every object with trigger-collider.

Have Fun!!!

P.S.: You have to wear the Myos with the USB-Port towards the wrist...
